# Prerequisites
Python 3.6 (get here: python.org)

discord.py rewrite (paste this in your terminal: python3 -m pip install -U git+https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py@rewrite#egg=discord.py[voice] )

Bot Application (make one here: https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me/create)
# Setup
First, replace the text in token.txt with your bot token and the marked text in cogs/utils/checks.py with your ID.

### But how do I get that?

Turn on developer mode in Discord's settings. Then right click yourself and click Copy ID. This is your ID.

### OK, back to the readme.

Then run bot.py. It's that simple!
