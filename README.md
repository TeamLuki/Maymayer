# Setup
First, replace the text in token.txt with your bot token and the marked text in cogs/utils/checks.py with your ID.

### But how do I get that?

Turn on developer mode in Discord's settings. Then right click yourself and click Copy ID. This is your ID.

### OK, back to the readme.

Then run bot.py. It's that simple!
