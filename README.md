# Prerequisites
Python 3

discord module

bot token
# Setup
First, replace the text in token.txt with your bot token and the marked text in cogs/utils/checks.py with your bot owner's ID.

### But how do I get that?

Turn on developer mode in Discord's settings. Then right click the bot owner and click Copy ID. This is your bot owner's ID.

### OK, back to the readme.

Then run bot.py. It's that simple!
